A nautical mile is a unit of distance used when sailing or flying. It is equal to
1.15078 miles. A colleage of mine told me that the definition of a nautical mile
is derived from the straight-line distance through the Earth between two points
on its surface. In other words, if you travelled along the surface of the Earth
a distance of 1 nautical mile, the straight line through the Earth connecting
your starting and ending positions would have a length of 1 regular mile.

I was not able to find any reference to this definition of a nautical mile.
[Wikipedia says that the nautical mile was originally defined to be one minute of
latitude along any line of longitude, but today it is defined as exactly 1852
meters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile). My intuition tells me that
it is probably not true. A 15% deviation over a distance of 1 mile seems
far too great given the large radius of the Earth.

Either way, it got me wondering about the straight-line distances between points
as you travel around the Earth. So I decided to find some answers for myself.
