    The Problem With Agile Software Development
---
- Agile in theory
  Agile manifesto
    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    Working software over comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    Responding to change over following a plan
- Agile in practice
  became buzzword
  agile consultants
  silver bullet
  $$$
  very loose definition of what is agile
  agile is cult/religious thinking
    agile is unquestionably true - it is heresy to question agile methodology
    the power of agile is unfalsifiable - if agile isn't working for you then you aren't doing it right
    satan/sins - made up evil to strike fear into beleivers - "waterfall"
    sacred texts - the agile manifesto
    high preits of the agile manifesto - interpreters of the word of god - agisle consultants
    ritualized behaviors - agile processes despite contradicting the agile manifesto's rejection of processes - scrum, standup, sprints, planning, retrospective, demo, grooming
    
- THe problem with agile today
  agile is not a replacement for thinking
  agile implementation focus on processes and tool rather than interations and common sense
  bad decisions are made in order to follow what is "agile"
  iteration cycles blind developers to long range requirements
    long range requirements cannot be addressed when only the timeframe of the next iteration is considered
    leads to lots of reworks
    discourages planning and design
      flexibility of requirements is not an excuse for not planning or doing design
      one committed to a set of requirements, you still need to plan and design a solution instead of jumping into coding
  estimation of task difficult is impossible
    story points are actually an obfuscated measure of time
    assigning points to a task makes it feel organized when really it's a complete guess
    judging team perfomance based on number of story points or completeness of sprint is not a meaningful metric
      it just measures how good the team is at guesstimating made up points
      encourages teams to under point their sprints so they can over perform
      a better metric is code quality - which is difficult to measure
  agile jargon obscures simple ideas and enforces procedural thinking instead of creative problem solving
    sprints - it's not a sprint if you do one after another. A sprint is a short burst of maximum speed. It should be called a run. But that's not a nice name. Call them iterations
    scrum - a term that comes from rugby. It means a status meeting. That's it. any other properties ascribed to it by agile consultants is stuff they made up.
