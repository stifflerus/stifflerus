title: Analysing Mr. Coffee Failure Mode
---

The standard drip coffee pot is marvel of value engineering as explained by Bill Hammock in this video. Few household appliances are simpler in construction. A coffee pot consists of a heater, a pump, and that's about it. Why then, do coffee pots never seem to last more than a year or so? I decided to perform an autopsy on my broken coffee machine to see if I could identify the cause of failure.

# Security screws wtf??
